Vtwt -- Ver's Twitter Client


  About
  -----

Vtwt is released under a BSD license (see LICENSE).


  Installation
  ------------

vtwt installs using a standard Python distutils setup.py:

  $ python setup.py install


  Configuration File
  ------------------

vtwt(1) reads a configuration file (~//vtwtrc, by default; specified with the
--config-file option) that is used to set configuration values that are
otherwise passed to the command-line.  This file may contain arbitrary Python:

  import hashlib
  user = "0b0t"
  password = hashlib.new("sha256", "i like to eet peeza"
        ).digest().encode("base64").strip()

...or whatever you fancy.  You probably shouldn't do anything with Twisted here
(and if you dare to try it, at least be kind enough to stop the reactor!).
